# Personal Dot Files

My personal settings, for *vim*, *tmux*, *bashrc*, and more coming
(not finished).

Heavily inspired by [rwxrob](https://github.com/rwxrob) and his [dot files](https://github.com/rwxrob/dot) with additional changes made by myself.

### Instant Setup

By using the [setup file](https://github.com/gardm1/setup) we can automatically setup wanted dependencies. <br />
If it's not an executable allready, you can make it one, by using the **chmod +x <File_Name>** command 

#### How To Use

After retriving the setup file

```bash
bash setup [Dependencie you wish to install]
```

You can also use the **help** command to list all the available packages for installation 

```bash
bash setup help
```
