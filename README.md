# Personal Dot Files

My personal settings, for *vim*, *tmux*, *bashrc*, and more coming
(not finished).

Heavily inspired by [rwxrob](https://github.com/rwxrob) and his [dot files](https://github.com/rwxrob/dot) with additional changes made by myself.

The setup file is used to automatically setup different dependencies that is often used.

### How To Use

After retriving the setup file

```bash
bash setup [Dependencie you wish to install]
```

You can also use the **help** command to list the different files and packages you can install

```bash
bash setup help
```
